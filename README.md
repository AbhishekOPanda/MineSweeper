# MineSweeper
The most popular game of all-time! Minesweeper is not only fun, but also challenging and addictive. You can win the game by avoiding mines that are buried somewhere in the grid! It's a terrific brain exercise. Every level, from Easy to Hard, is pre-set, so you may play a quick game whenever you like. A fixed board allows you to restart the game from the same level if you wish to rerun the same level multiple times. By pressing the home button on the board and choosing from the alternatives, you can restart the game with a different level of difficulty. In the near future, me and my fellow developer (Pravar Goel) intend to further develop it. Hope you like it.
